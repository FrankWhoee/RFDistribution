Description: These codes implement an improved version of the RF distribution computation by Bryant et al. Here, we modified the dynamic programming algorithm introduced by Bryant et al for computing the distribution of RF distance for a given tree by leveraging the Number-Theoretic Transform (NTT), and improve the running time from O(l^5) to O(l^3log(l)), where l is the number of tips of the tree.
